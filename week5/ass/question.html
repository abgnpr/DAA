        <h1>Padayatra</h1>

        <p><em>(IOI Training Camp, 2004)</em> </p>

        <p>The exit polls indicate that the sitting MLA is likely to lose the
            upcoming election. The party high command instructs him to undertake
            a padayatra through his constituency to boost his popularity. To
            maximize coverage of the constituency, the party decides that he
            should choose a circular route that returns to the starting point
            without using any road twice. The route need not visit all the towns
            and villages in the constituency.</p>

        <p>Being averse to physical exercise, the MLA would like to minimize the
            distance that he has to walk. He has a helicopter at his disposal, so
            he can begin the padayatra at any town or village.</p>

        <p>The task is to help him find the shortest circular route. You are
            guaranteed that there is always at least one circular route.</p>

        <h2>Solution Hint</h2>

        <p> Given an edge (i,j) with weight W(i,j), the shortest cycle
            from i to i via j can be found by temporarily deleting the edge
            (i,j), finding the shortest path from j to i, and then adding
            W(i,j) to the length of this path. Do this systematically to
            find the shortest cycle in the graph.</p>

        <h2>Input format</h2>

        <p>The first line of input is an integer N, 1 ≤ N ≤ 1000, the
            number of roads in the constituency. The constituency has no more
            than 300 towns and villages connected by roads. </p>

        <p>The next N lines specify the roads. Each line consists of three
            space separated integers S, T and D where S is the starting
            point of the road, T is the ending point and D is the length of
            the road. Each road is a two-way road and is listed exactly
            once, in one of the two directions.</p>


        <h2>Output format</h2>

        <p>
            A single line with the integer distance around the shortest possible
            circular route.
        </p>


        <h2>Test data</h2>

        <p>
            There are at most 300 towns and villages and at most 1000 roads.
