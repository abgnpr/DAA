    <h1>Road Trips and Museums</h1>

    </p>

    <p>
        Lavanya and Nikhil have <b>K</b> months of holidays ahead of
        them, and they want to go on exactly <b>K</b> road trips, one a
        month. They have a map of the various cities in the world with
        the roads that connect them. There are <b>N</b> cities, numbered
        from 1 to <b>N</b>. We say that you can reach city B from city A
        if there is a sequence of roads that starts from city A and ends
        at city B. Note that the roads are bidirectional. Hence, if you
        can reach city B from city A, you can also reach city A from city
        B.
    </p>

    <p>
        Lavanya first decides which city to start from. In the first
        month, they will start from that city, and they will visit every
        city that they can reach by road from that particular city, even
        if it means that they have to pass through cities that they have
        already visited previously. Then, at the beginning of the second
        month, Nikhil picks a city that they haven't visited till
        then. In the second month, they first fly to that city and visit
        all the cities that they can reach from that city by road. Then,
        in the third month, Lavanya identifies a city, and they fly there
        and visit all cities reachable from there by road. Then in the
        fourth month it is Nikhil's turn to choose an unvisited city to
        start a road trip, and they alternate like this. Note that the
        city that they fly to (that is, the city from where they start
        each month's road trip) is also considered as being visited.
    </p>

    <p>
        Each city has some museums, and when they visit a city for the
        first time, Lavanya makes them visit each of the museums
        there. Lavanya loves going to museums, but Nikhil hates
        them. Lavanya always makes her decisions so that they visit the
        maximum number of museums possible that month, while Nikhil picks
        cities so that the number of museums visited that month is
        minimized.
    </p>

    <p>
        Given a map of the roads, the number of museums in each city, and
        the number <b>K</b>, find the total number of museums that they
        will end up visiting at the end of <b>K</b> months. Print -1 if
        they will have visited all the cities before the beginning of the
        <b>K</b><sup>th</sup> month, and hence they will be left bored at
        home for some of the <b>K</b> months.
    </p>

    <h2>Solution hint</h2>

    <p>
        Use BFS/DFS to identify the connected components of the
        underlying undirected graph. Sort the components based on how
        many museums they contain and make appropriate choices for
        Lavanya and Nikhil each month.
    </p>

    <h2>Input format</h2>

    <ul>

        <li>The first line of each testcase contains three integers:
            <b>N</b>, <b>M</b> and <b>K</b>, which represents the number of
            cities, number of roads and the number of months.</li>

        <li>The i<sup>th</sup> of the next <b>M</b> lines contains two
            integers, <b>u<sub>i</sub></b> and <b>v<sub>i</sub></b>. This
            denotes that there is a direct road between city
            <b>u<sub>i</sub></b> and city <b>v<sub>i</sub></b>.</li>

        <li>The next line contains <b>N</b> integers, the i<sup>th</sup>
            of which represents the number of museums in city i.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>Output format</h2>

    <p>
        If they can go on <b>K</b> road trips, output a single line
        containing a single integer which should be the total number of
        museums they visit in the <b>K</b> months. Output -1 if they
        can't go on <b>K</b> road trips.
    </p>

    <h3>Explanation</h3>

    <p>
        Notice that in all the three testcases, everything is the same,
        except for the value of <b>K</b>. The following figure represents
        the road map in these testcases. Each node denotes a city, with a
        label of the form "<em>n</em> (<em>m</em>)", where <em>n</em> is
        the city number, between 1 and <b>N</b>, and <em>m</em> is the
        number of museums in this city. For example, the node with label
        "5 (25)" represents city 5, which has 25 museums.</p>

    <p>
        <b>Testcase 1</b>: Lavanya will first choose to fly to city 8. In
        the first month, they visit only that city, but they visit 150
        museums.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then in the second month, Nikhil could choose to fly to city 3,
        and they visit the cities 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6, and visit 20 + 0 + 15
        + 25 + 30 = 90 museums that month. Note that Nikhil could have
        instead chosen to fly to city 1 or 2 or 5 or 6, and they would
        all result in the same scenario.
    </p>

    <p>
        Then, Lavanya could choose city 7, and in the third month they
        will visit the cities 7, 4, 10 and 9. Note that Lavanya could
        have chosen to fly to city 4 or 10 or 9, and they would all
        result in the same scenario.
    </p>

    <p>
        In total, they have visited 345 museums in the three months
        (which is in fact all the museums), and that is the answer.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Testcase 2</b>: It is same as the previous testcase, but now
        they have only 2 months. So they visit only 150 + 90 = 240
        museums in total.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>Testcase 3</b>: It is same as the previous testcase, but now
        they have 5 months of holidays. But sadly, they finish visiting
        all the cities within the first three months itself, and hence
        the answer is -1.
