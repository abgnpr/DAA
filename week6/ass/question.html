        <h1>Book cartons</h1>

        <p> A university department is shifting its department library to
            a more spacious room on a newly constructed floor. The books
            from the library have been packed into <em>m</em> cartons,
            numbered <em>1, 2, …, m</em>,
            containing <em>b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>, …,
                b<sub>m</sub></em> books, respectively, and transported to the new
            library room.</p>

        <p> There are <em>k</em> student volunteers available to unpack
            the <em>m</em> cartons, where <em>k ≤ m</em>. Each carton
            must be assigned to a single volunteer, and every volunteer
            must get a non-empty continuous sequence of cartons to unpack.</p>

        <p> More formally, we need to find numbers <em>0 = c<sub>0</sub>
                &lt; c<sub>1</sub> &lt; c<sub>2</sub> &lt; … &lt;
                c<sub>k</sub> = m</em> such that volunteer <em>j</em>, <em>1
                ≤ j ≤ k</em> unpacks cartons <em>c<sub>j-1</sub>+1</em>
            to <em>c<sub>j</sub></em>.</p>

        <p> The time each volunteer takes to unpack a carton is directly
            proportional to the number of books in the carton. The goal is
            parallelize the unpacking to finish in the fastest possible
            time. For this, we need to assign cartons such that the
            maximum number of books assigned to any one volunteer is
            minimized.</p>


        <h2>Solution hint</h2>

        <p> Given a target <em>T</em>, use a greedy strategy to check if
            there is a legal allocation where no volunteer is assigned more
            than <em>T</em> books. Find the optimum <em>T</em> using
            binary search. Note that if a greedy strategy finds an
            allocation achieving target <em>T</em> using <em>k' &lt; k</em>
            volunteers, this allocation can always be subdivided to achieve
            the same target with exactly <em>k</em> volunteers. </p>

        <h2>Input format</h2>

        <p>Each test case consists of exactly two lines. The first line
            has are two integers <em>m</em> and <em>k</em>. The second
            line has <em>m</em> integers <em>b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>,
                …, b<sub>m</sub></em> separated by spaces.</p>

        <h2>Output format</h2>

        <p> Your output should be a single line with the input
            sequence <em>b<sub>1</sub>, b<sub>2</sub>, …,
                b<sub>m</sub></em> divided into exactly <em>k</em> parts such that
            the maximum sum in a single part is as small as possible. Use
            the slash character (<tt>'/'</tt>) to separate the parts. There
            must be exactly one space character between any two successive
            numbers and between the number and the slash. If there is more
            than one solution, print the one that minimizes the work
            assigned to the first volunteer, then to the second volunteer
            etc. Each volunteer must be assigned at least one carton. </p>

        <h2>Test Data:</h2>

        <p> You may assume that <em>1 ≤ k ≤ m ≤ 500</em>,
            always. Also, each carton contains a positive number of books,
            which is less than 10,000,000. </p>

        <h2>Sample Input 1:</h2>

        <pre style="margin:15px">9 3
  100 200 300 400 500 600 700 800 900
  </pre>

        <h2>Sample Output 1:</h2>

        <pre style="margin:15px">100 200 300 400 500 / 600 700 / 800 900
  </pre>

        <h2>Sample Input 2:</h2>

        <pre style="margin:15px">5 4
  100 100 100 100 100
  </pre>

        <h2>Sample Output 2:</h2>

        <pre style="margin:15px">100 / 100 / 100 / 100 100
