        <h1>Here there be Dragons</h1>
        <p><em>(IOI Training Camp, 2012)</em></p>
    
        <p>The kingdom is falling into ruin. People live in fear. Dragons
            pillage, kill, and just generally cause as much havoc as they
            possibly can. The king has just sent out a royal decree:</p>
    
        <blockquote>
            <em>To any man out there who is able to bring me the heads of K
                dragons, I shall bequeath a lordship–to him, his sons and his
                grandsons, till the end of time.</em>
        </blockquote>
    
        <p>Having seen this royal decree, and knowing that you are
            capable of killing dragons thanks to your extensive medieval
            combat training, you set out on a quest to hunt down the evil
            creatures. Being a busy kind of guy, you would like to
            complete your quest quickly and kill K dragons through the
            shortest route.</p>
    
        <p>The kingdom is arranged in a grid with R rows, numbered 0 to
            R-1, and C columns, numbered 0 to C-1 You start your quest
            at the top left corner of the grid, (0,0).</p>
    
        <p>The total number of dragons in the kingdom is D, of which you
            have to kill K. Dragons are very territorial in nature, so
            each row of the grid contains at most one dragon. Also, since
            the kingdom is situated on a hill, you travel only downwards on
            the grid, though you may move left or right as you please.</p>
    
        <p> You are told that no two dragons are on the same row of the
            grid. Also, no dragon is at position (0,0).</p>
    
        <p>For example, suppose the grid has 5 rows and 5 columns with 3
            dragons, of which you have to kill any 2. The three dragons
            are located at (1,4), (2,3) and (4,4), as shown below. In this
            case, your shortest route is to take 7 steps and kill the
            dragons in row 1 and row 2. Killing any other combination of 2
            dragons takes 8 steps, so this is the minimum possible. Note
            that once you've killed K dragons, you don't incur any cost
            to return home. You just want to find how long it takes to do
            all the killing.

        <h2>Solution hint</h2>
    
        <p> Number the dragons 1,2,…,D in ascending order of rows.
            Let mindist(i,j) denote the minimum distance travelled
            when the j<sup>th</sup> dragon killed is dragon i. Recall the
            constraint that there is no dragon at (0,0). Use dynamic
            programming to compute mindist(i,j) for all values of i and j,
            then find the minimum among mindist(i,K) for all i ≥ K.
        </p>
    
        <h2>Input format</h2>
    
        <ul>
            <li> Line 1 : Four space-separated integers, R, C, K and D.
            </li>
            <li> Lines 2 to D+1 : Each line has two-space separated
                integers r and c, the row and column of the corresponding dragon.
            </li>
        </ul>
    
    
        <h2>Output format</h2>
    
        <p> A single integer, the minimum total distance travelled to kill K
            dragons. </p>
    
    
        <h2>Test Data:</h2>
    
        <ul>
    
            <li> In all subtasks, K ≤ D ≤ R, and, for each dragon
                position (r,c), 0 ≤ r &lt; R, and 0 ≤ c &lt; C.
            </li>
            <li> No two dragons will be on the same row.
            </li>
            <li> No dragon will be at position (0,0).
    
            </li>
        </ul>
