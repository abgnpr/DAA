  <p>
    There are <b>C</b> cakes in a row, numbered from 1 to
    <b>C</b>. There are <b>N</b> children, each of whom have selected
    a consecutive set of cakes to eat. That is, Child i has decided
    to eat all the cakes from <b>S<sub>i</sub></b> to
    <b>E<sub>i</sub></b>, end points inclusive. If there is a cake
    which appears in some two childrens' set, then they will fight
    because both of them want to eat that cake, and you don't want
    that to happen.
  </p>

  <p>
    You will be given an integer <b>K</b> which will be either 0 or
    1. If <b>K </b>is 0, then you should find out if some two
    children will fight. Print "Good" if no one fights, and "Bad" if
    someone fights.
  </p>

  <p>
    If <b>K</b> is 1, then you can persuade at most one child to
    change his decision to some other set of cakes. But the number of
    cakes that he eats must be the same. That is, if Child i had
    initially decided that he wants to eat the cakes from
    <b>S<sub>i</sub></b> to <b>E<sub>i</sub></b>, then you could
    persuade the child to instead eat the cakes from X to Y instead,
    for any valid X and Y (ie. 1 ≤ X ≤ Y ≤ <b>C</b>),
    provided that the number of cakes is the same
    (ie. <b>E<sub>i</sub></b> - <b>S<sub>i</sub></b> + 1 = Y - X +
    1). If after persuading at most 1 Child to change his decision,
    no fights happen, then print "Good". But if no matter what you
    do, someone will fight, then print "Bad".

  <h2>Solution hint</h2>

  <p>
    Sort the intervals and check for overlaps.
  </p>

  <h2>Input format</h2>

  <p>
    The first line of each test case contains three integers
    <b>C</b>, <b>N</b> and <b>K</b> denoting the number of cakes,
    number of children and <b>K</b>, respectively.</p>

  <p>The i-th of the next <b>N</b> lines contains two space
    separated integers <b>S<sub>i</sub></b> and <b>E<sub>i</sub></b>
    which denotes the initial decision of Child i. That is, Child i
    wants to eat from cake <b>S<sub>i</sub></b> to cake
    <b>E<sub>i</sub></b>.</p>

  <p></p>

  <h2>Output format</h2>

  <p>
    For each test case, output a single line containing "Good" or
    "Bad".
  </p>

  <h3>Explanation</h3>

  <p><b>Sample 1:</b> Child 1 wants to eat the second cake, and Child 2 wants to eat Cakes 3, 4 and 5. So there is no
    fight, and the answer is "Good".</p>

  <p><b>Sample 2:</b> Child 1 wants to eat Cake 2, and Child 2 wants to eat Cakes 2, 3, 4 and 5. Both of them want to
    eat Cake 2, and hence it could lead to a fight. But because <b>K</b> = 1, we can persuade one of the children to
    change their decision. For instance, we could persuade Child 1 to change his decision from [2, 2] to [1, 1]. After
    this, there is no fight, and the hence answer is "Good".</p>

  <p><b>Sample 3:</b> Child 1 wants to eat Cake 2 and Cake 3, and Child 2 wants to eat Cakes 2, 3, 4 and 5. Both of them
    want to eat Cakes 2 and 3, and hence it could lead to a fight. And because <b>K</b> = 1, we can persuade one of the
    children to change their decision. For instance, we could persuade Child 1 to change his decision from [2, 3] to [1,
    2]. But even after this, both of them want to eat Cake 2. You can verify that no matter how we persuade at most 1
    child, they will end up fighting. Hence the answer is "Bad".</p>
